THE PROJECT USES 2020.3.30f1 version of Unity
The project has an interesting broom flight system where it reads the inputs and can hover or change flight speed.
I also liked its combat system that add debuffs of fire or frost or can make buffs to players based off integers.
It also has some in depthed scripting regarding quest and what happens within them as far as items collected and whether or not the quest was completed.
The prefabs for potions and the environment itself is very impressive to it really looks like hogwarts for a unity game. 
I liked and learned how the mechanics come together to create the expierence you want for the player. The broom flight was really cool and it easy to follow 
how they were able to make it hover and accelerate.
